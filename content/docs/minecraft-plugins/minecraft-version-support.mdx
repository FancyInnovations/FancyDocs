title: Minecraft Version Support
---

The following rules apply to every Minecraft plugin developed by us.

Every minecraft version that comes out will be supported for **18 months (1.5 years)** from the date of release.
During this time, we will ensure that our plugins are compatible with that version and will provide updates as necessary.
After the 18 month, we will drop support for that version and the plugins will no longer work on it.
You will need to use old versions of the plugins if you wish to use them on unsupported Minecraft versions.

We will only support the latest hotfix version of each game drop.
Let's say Minecraft 26.1 just released, we will immediately start supporting it.
If Mojang now releases Minecraft 26.1.1 as a hotfix, we will drop support for Minecraft 26.1 and only support Minecraft 26.2 going forward.
This means that if you are using an older hotfix version, you will need to update to the latest hotfix version to continue using our plugins.
