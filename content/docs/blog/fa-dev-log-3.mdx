## Some numbers

Let's start by looking at some numbers again, which have changed since the last dev log.
There are +78 new users on the waiting list (since the last dev log), bringing the total to **148** users on the list.

The number of recorded data points has increased to **1.6 million** and the total number of errors is now **1.3 million**.
The total number of events is now **1 million**.

FancyAnalytics now receives data from about **14k** unique clients per day, with a total of **40 million** incoming requests per day.

It's impressive to see how FancyAnalytics is growing, even without any marketing.

## Current state of the platform

The new backend is working. It's not perfect yet, but the core functionality is there.
All services are implemented and communicate with each other as expected.
The new database is running and storing data as expected.

The frontend is still not complete, but we're making good progress.
Well to make the frontend usable, only the actual charts on the dashboards are missing.
You can already create projects, create dashboards, add metrics and apply templates to quickly set up common use cases.

The foundation for project members, public dashboards and more login methods is already prepared, but will be available later.
I also made concepts for alerts, reports and actual real-time data, but the priority is to get the core functionality working first.
A complete list of implemented and planned features will be provided before the next beta phase starts.

The next step is to deploy the new platform to production and run integration tests to ensure everything works as expected, then getting start receiving real data.

## Roadmap

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Local integration tests (done)

        I'm currently working on local integration tests for the new platform to ensure that everything works as expected before deploying to production.
        This includes testing ingesting data, processing it, and storing it in the database as well as retrieving and visualizing the data on the dashboards.
        Additionally, I'm testing the current SDKs (mainly the Go SDK) to ensure they work seamlessly with the new platform.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Prod deployment of all new services (doing this right now)

        Everything is already prepared for production deployment, such as Docker images, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code.
        I'm going to rent a new (more powerful) server for the new platform and deploy all services there.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Integration tests on prod

        After deploying to production, I'm going to run the same integration tests as before, but this time on the production environment.
        I'll also do some load testing to ensure the platform can handle the expected traffic.
        This will be the first time the new platform is running in a real-world environment, so I'm expecting to find some issues that need to be fixed.
        Especially I'm curious how the new database performs under load.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Finish SDKs and add more templates

        I've already made good progress on the SDKs, but there are still some features missing and some bugs to fix.

        Currently the following SDKs are in progress:
        - General Java SDK (Java applications, Spring Boot, Android, etc.)
        - Minecraft API (for plugin developers to easily track plugin usage of their plugins)
        - Minecraft plugin (to track performance, entity, player and world stats (and many more) of Minecraft servers)
        - Hytale API & plugin (similar to the Minecraft SDK and plugin, but for Hytale)
        - Go SDK (for Go applications tracking performance and http stats)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Finish documentation for new platform and SDKs

        The whole documentation needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new platform and the new SDKs.
        There is not much documentation yet for the new platform, so this will take some time.
        But I want to make sure that everything is well documented before the public release.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Test the new platform with our own plugins

        I'm going to use the new Minecraft API to track the usage of our own plugins (FancyNpcs, FancyHolograms and FancyDialogs).
        This will help me to identify any issues with the new platform and SDKs, as well as to gather some real-world data to test the dashboards and visualizations.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Migrate all current users to the new platform

        Once everything is working well, I'm going to migrate all current users (who have an account) to the new platform.
        They will receive an email with instructions on how to access their new account and can start using the new platform (read more about the migration process below).
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Migrate the waiting list users to the new platform

        After the current users have been migrated, I'm going to migrate the users on the waiting list to the new platform.
        They will also receive an email with instructions on how to access their new account.
        At this point the platform will have roughly 200 users already on it, which should be a good starting point for the public release.
        Hopefully we can identify and fix any remaining issues before opening the platform to the public - this requires feedback from real users.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Open the new platform to the public

        Finally, once everything is working well and all users have been migrated, I'm going to open the new platform to the public.
        This means that anyone can create an account and start using FancyAnalytics.

        I'll also start publishing the Minecraft plugin on Modrinth to reach a wider audience.
    </Step>
</Steps>

I can not give you a specific date for the public release yet, as there are still many unknowns and potential issues that could arise during the testing and migration process.
But I'm aiming to open the platform to the public in January or February.

## Migration

Everyone who currently has an account or is on the waiting list will be automatically migrated to the new platform.
You will receive an email once the migration is complete with instructions on how to access your new account.
No data will be migrated, you will have to recreate all your projects and dashboards on the new platform.
This is because the data model has changed significantly, and it would take too much time to migrate all the data.

<Callout type="warn">
    It's important that you set a valid email address in your current account settings, otherwise your account cannot be migrated.
    You can check and update your email address on the profile settings page.
</Callout>

Creating new projects and dashboards is easier than before thanks to the new templates.
There are tons of pre-built templates for different use cases for you to choose from, so you can get started quickly.
Each template comes with pre-defined metrics and dashboards with charts to visualize the data.
So you just need to apply the desired templates and use the new SDKs to begin tracking data again.

I know there are currently a few Minecraft plugins that use FancyAnalytics to track their plugin usage.
There will be a dedicated migration process for these plugins to make the transition as smooth as possible.
There are thousands of servers still sending data to the old project IDs, so I will provide a way to **link the old project IDs to the new ones**.
Just create a ticket on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZUgYCEJUEx), provide your old project ID and the new project ID, and I will link them together.
All data sent to the old project ID will then be automatically forwarded to the new project ID for a limited time to give you enough time to update your plugins with the new project ID.
This means you don't have to update your plugins immediately after the migration, but you should do it as soon as possible to avoid any data loss.
If you have any questions or need help with the migration, feel free to reach out on the Discord server.

## Conclusion

FancyAnalytics is making great progress and is getting closer to next beta phase.
I still can't give you a specific date for the release, as I still have a lot of work to do, but I hope you are as excited as I am about the upcoming features and improvements.
Right now the focus is on testing the new platform and getting real data flowing through it as soon as possible.

Thank you for your continued support and interest in FancyAnalytics!

You can still join the [waiting list](https://fancyanalytics.net/register/) and get access to the beta version once it's available.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZUgYCEJUEx) or dm me on Discord (real_oliver).
