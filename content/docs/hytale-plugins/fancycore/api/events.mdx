FancyCore has its own event system that allows you to listen to various events that happen in the FancyCore system.

## Registering an event listener

Example for registering a listener for the `PlayerReportedEvent`:

```java
EventService eventService = FancyCore.get().getEventService();
eventService.registerListener(PlayerReportedEvent.class, (event) -> {
    System.out.println("PlayerReportedEvent fired with report id: " + event.getReport().id());
});
```
